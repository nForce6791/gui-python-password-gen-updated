# gui-python-password-gen-updated

A simple password generator that I made in python

What does it include? Let me tell you:

- Allows you to generate a password anywhere from 8-128 characters!

- Has sliders and checkboxes that allow you to customize the password

- Copies to clipboard


How do you compile it into a .exe?

`pip install pyinstaller`

There. Now, CD into the directory that you have saved the file. EG: `cd C:\Users\YOURUSER\Desktop`

Now, write: `pyinstaller --onefile password.generator.py`

Boom!

OR python password.gen.py
